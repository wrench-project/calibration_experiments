# Running experiments

Before running any of the scripts in this folder, be sure to have completed the installation/configuration of the submit and worker nodes (found in the `../setup` folder).

Scripts in this folder should be run from the **submit** node.

## Running Workflows

This is done running/editing the `./run_all_experiments.sh` script.


## The sanity script

This script can be run once we have a lot of .json files in a directory to look at the makespan and detect things that don't make sense
